About me

I'm Yu-Jen from Taiwan.

I graduated from National Taiwan University with a BS in Life Science.
and participated an exchange student to UC Berkeley as an exchange student with a concentration in computational biology.

My research interest is computational genomics, especially in exploring methods to decipher high-throughput omics data.
