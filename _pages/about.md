I'm Yu-Jen from Taiwan.

I graduated from National Taiwan University with a BS in Life Science.
and participated an exchange student to UC Berkeley as an exchange student with a concentration in computational biology.

My research interest is computational genomics, especially in exploring methods to decipher high-throughput omics data.



I'm an assistant professor at the [Wharton Statistics Department](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/). My [research](https://ekatsevi.github.io/research/) centers on several interconnected themes, spanning statistical theory, methodology, and applications. I work on modern

I covered several recent research interests at a recent talk at the Selective Inference Seminar ([recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rry78o2BbGkPxssRfnFFnJ4Y9hKHuKmI/view?usp=sharing)). 

I greatly enjoy [teaching and mentoring](https://ekatsevi.github.io/mentoring/), and am actively seeking PhD students. Please reach out to me if you're interested!
